Pktgen version 2.8.1 using DPDK-1.8.0
=====================================

**Pktgen is a traffic generator powered by Intel's DPDK at 10Gbit wire rate traffic with 64 byte frames.**

**Sounds like 'Packet-Gen'**

**=== Modifications ===**
 - 2.8.1   - Add a new docs directory using Sphinx format and update version numbers.
 - 2.8.0   - Update to release 1.8.0 of DPDK.
 - 2.7.7   - Update Lua to 5.2.3 and fixed setting vlan ID on single ports plus added new Lua functions
			 New Lua functions are pktgen.portCount() and pktgen.totalPorts() portCount() is the number of
			 port used by Pktgen and totalPorts() is the total number seen by DPDK.
 - 2.7.6   - Update code from dpdk.org version of Pktgen, which hopefull fixes the send foreve problem.
 - 2.7.5   - Update to latest dpdk.org and move scrn to lib directory with name changes.
 - 2.7.4   - Removed old printf_info() calls for printf_status() calls.
 - 2.7.3   - Fixed race condition with updating the TX count value with a small count.
 - 2.7.1   - Add a command line option '-T' to enable themes and set themes off by default.
 - 2.7.0   - Update to DPDK 1.7.0, Note: DPDK 1.7.0 changed how ports are detected and blacklisted,
             which means the port index is now different. You will need to blacklist or whitelist ports
             with the DPDK '-b' or '--pci-blacklist or --pci-whitelist' options. Pktgen does not blacklist
             ports anymore.
           - Moved pktgen to the examples directory plus removed the libwr_* from the lib directory
           - Pktgen now supports ANSI color terminals only the main screen ATM, but more later.
           - Best viewed on a black background display, unless you want to change it with the new theme commands.
           - More supported generator types, checkout the help screens.
 - 2.6.8   - Fixed a transmit problem when count is set to one. Plus increase the link down delays.
 - 2.6.7   - Add more support for GRE packets, log support and more testing code.
 - 2.6.6   - Fix compile problem when not SSE4.2 instructions are not supported. Allowing QEMU and other
             systems to build and run. Also added a patch to take into account huge reserved pages.
 - 2.6.5   - Added support for logging packet information.
 - 2.6.4   - It consists of 3 commits: improvements to the pktgen-random.c unit tests,
             the real CentOS compilation fixes and a small update to tap.{c,h} so they
             are identical to those from zorgnax/libtap on github.
 - 2.6.3   - Add a delay when traffic stops to make sure all packets are sent.
             Remove the `rte_hash_crc.h` include in wr_pcap.c file.
 - 2.6.2   - Fixup GRE and ARP problems
 - 2.6.1   - Add random bits support and more cleanup
 - 2.6.0   - Split up the code for testing to be added later
 - 2.5.2   - Remove extra ethertypes.h file.
 - 2.5.1   - Added the following updates.
           - Implement-Rx-packet-dump-functionality
           - Add-packet-capture-functionality
           - Add-MPLS-functionality
           - Add-Q-in-Q-802.11ad-functionality
           - Add-GRE-header-generation
           - Fix-UDP-TCP-ICMP-protocol-selection
           - Add-ARP-protocol
 - 2.5.0   - Update to DPDK 1.6.0 plus a few bug fixes.
 - 2.4.1   - Fixed a bug in range packets when 'inc' value is zero use start values.
 - 2.4.0   - Add support for TX tap packets. Change 'tap' command to rxtap and txtap.
 - 2.3.4   - Minor update to help eliminate RX errors and be able to receive at wire rate.

 - 2.3.2   - Fixed VLAN detection problem in ARP and special GARP support.
 - 2.3.1   - Getting closer to line rate tx speed.
 - 2.3.0   - Now supports the VLAN encapsulated packets for ARP replies
             Also added a special GARP processing to update the destination MAC
             address to help support a special request for failover support.
             Added support for DPDK 1.5.1
 - 2.2.7   - Updated the code to handle multiple TX queues per port.
 - 2.2.6   - Fixed a crash if the port is not up with link status
 - 2.2.5   - Remove the flow control code as some systems it does not work.

README for setting up Pktgen with DPDK on Ubuntu 10.04 to 13.10 desktop, it
should work on most Linux systems as long as the kernel has hugeTLB page support.

*** Note: Tested with Ubuntu 13.10 and up to 14.04 kernel version
    Linux 3.5.0-25-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 25 18:26:58 UTC 2013 x86_64

I am using Ubuntu 13.10 x86_64 (64 bit support) for running pktgen/DPDK on a
Westmere Dual socket board running at 2.4GHz with 12GB of ram 6GB per socket.
The current kernel version is 3.5.0-25 (as of 2013-03-18) support, but should
work on just about any new Linux kernel version.

To get hugeTLB page support your Linux kernel must be at least 2.6.33 and in the
DPDK documents it talks about how you can upgrade your Linux kernel.

Here is another document on how to upgrade your Linux kernel.
Ubuntu 10.04 is 2.6.32 by default so upgraded to kernel 2.6.34 using this HOWTO:
http://usablesoftware.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/switch-to-a-newer-kernel-in-ubuntu-10-04/

The pktgen output display needs 132 columns and about 42 lines to display
correctly. I am using an xterm of 132x42, but you can have a larger display
and maybe a bit smaller. If you are displaying more then 4-6 ports then you
will need a wider display. The pktgen allows you to view a set ports if they
do not all fit on the screen at one time via the 'page' command in pktgen.
Type 'help' at the 'pktgen>' prompt to see the complete pktgen command line
commands. Pktgen uses VT100 control codes or escape codes to display the screens,
which means your terminal must support VT100. The Hyperterminal in windows is not
going to work for Pktgen as it has a few problems with VT100 codes.

The pktgen program as built can send up to 16 packets per port in a sequence
and you can configure a port using the 'seq' pktgen command. A script file
can be loaded from the shell command line via the -f option and you can 'load'
a script file from within pktgen as well.

In the BIOS make sure the HPET High Precision Event Timer is enabled. Also
make sure hyper-threading is enabled.

** NOTE **
  On a 10GB NIC if the transceivers are not attached the screen updates will go
  very slow, but you can configure pktgen via the '-p' option to exclude those
  ports from pktgen and everything will be fine.

Get the DPDK and pktgen source code from github.com or dpdk.org repo via:
```
# cd <InstallDir>
# git clone git://dpdk.org/dpdk.git
```
```
# cd <InstallDir>
# git clone git://dpdk.org/pktgen-dpdk.git
```
** Note **
  The site dpdk.org you must also pull down DPDK repo as well. git://dpdk.org/dpdk

Will create a directory called Pktgen-DPDK in the current directory location. Using
this clone command you will get DPDK and pktgen source files.

Make sure you have HUGE TLB support in the kernel with the following commands:
```
# grep -i huge /boot/config-2.6.35-24-generic 
CONFIG_HUGETLBFS=y
CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE=y

# grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
HugePages_Total:      128
HugePages_Free:       128
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
```
NOTE: The values in Total and Free maybe different until you reboot the machine.

Two files in /etc must be setup to support huge TLBs. If you do not have
hugeTLB support then you most likely need a newer kernel.
```
# vi /etc/sysctl.conf
Add to the bottom of the file:
vm.nr_hugepages=256
```
If you need more or less hugeTLB pages then you can change the value to a
number you need it to be. In some cases pktgen needs a fair number of pages
and making it too small will effect performance or pktgen will terminate on
startup looking for more pages.
```
# vi /etc/fstab
Add to the bottom of the file:
huge /mnt/huge hugetlbfs defaults 0 0

# mkdir /mnt/huge
# chmod 777 /mnt/huge
```
Reboot your machine as the huge pages must be setup just after boot to make
sure you have contiguous memory for the 2Meg pages.

** Note: If you startup Eclipse or WR Workbench before starting pktgen the first
   time after reboot, pktgen will fail to load because it can not get all of the
   huge pages as eclipse has consumed some of the huge pages. If you did start eclipse
   or WR Workbench then you need to close that application first. 

This is my current machine you will have a few different numbers depending on 
how your system was booted and if you had hugeTLB support enabled.

At the ${RTE_SDK}/examples/pktgen level directory we have the 'setup' script,
which needs to be run as root once per boot. The script contains a commands to setup
the environment.

Make sure you run the setup script as root via 'sudo ./setup'. The setup script
is a bash script and tries to setup the system correctly, but you may have to 
change the script to match your number of huge pages you configured above.

The modprobe uio command, in the setup script, loads the UIO support module into the
kernel plus it loads the igb-uio.ko module into the kernel. The two echo commands,
in the setup script, finish setting up the huge pages one for each socket. If you
only have a single socket system then comment out the second echo command. The last
command is to display the huge TLB setup.

Edit your .bashrc or .profile or .cshrc to add the environment variables.
I am using bash:
`# vi ~/.bashrc`
Add the following lines: Change the $RTE_SDK to the location of the DPDK version
directory. Your SDK directory maybe named differently, but should point to the DPDK
SDK directory.

Make sure you have the Linux kernel headers installed as DPDK requires them to build
the kernel modules. On Ubuntu I run the following:

`# sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-32-generic`

You will need to adjust the version number to match your current kernel version.
If you upgrade your system or kernel version you will need to install the correct
headers and rebuild the RTE_TARGET directory.

```
# sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

export RTE_SDK=<DPDKinstallDir>
export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
or use clang if you have it installed
export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-clang
```
Create the DPDK build tree:
```
# cd $RTE_SDK
# make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
```
This above command will create the x86_64-pktgen-linuxapp-gcc directory in the
top level of the current-dkdp directory. The above command will build the basic
DPDK libraries and build tree.

Next we build pktgen:
```
# cd <PktgenInstallDir>
# make
```
You should now have pktgen built and to run pktgen type 'sudo ./doit', which is a script
to help with the command line options of pktgen. You may need to modify this script for
your system and configuration.
```
# cat doit
#!/bin/bash

# Normal setup
#   different cores for each port.

name=`uname -n`
if [ $name == "keithw-W2600CR" ]; then
./app/pktgen -c 1f -n 3 --proc-type auto --socket-mem 256,256 --file-prefix pg -b 0000:03:00.0 -b 0000:03:00.1 -- -p 0x00c -P -m "[1:3].0, [2:4].1" 
fi

if [ $name == "keithw-S5520HC" ]; then
./app/pktgen -c 1f -n 3 --proc-type auto --socket-mem 256,256 --file-prefix pg -b 0000:01:00.0 -b 0000:01:00.1 -- -p 0x03 -P -m "[1:3].0, [2:4].1" 
fi
```
** Note: The '-m NNN' in the DPDK arguments is to have DPDK allocate 512 megs of memory.
   The '--socket-mem 256,156' DPDK command will allocate 256M from each CPU (two in this
   case). Do not use the '-m NNN' and '--socket-mem NN,NN' commands on the same command
   line.
   
The pktgen program follows the same format as a standard DPDK linuxapp, meaning
the first set of arguments '-c 1f' are the standard DPDK arguments. This option
defines the number of logical cores to be used by pktgen. The 1f states 5 lcores
are used and the '3c' is just a bit array for each lcore to be used. The '-P' enables
promiscuous mode on all ports if you need that support. The '-m "..."' sets up the
port to lcore mapping for pktgen. 

The second half of the command line followed by the '--' is pktgen specific
options.

The pktgen requires 2 logical cores for a minimum system. The first lcore 0 used
for pktgen command line and is used for timers also displaying the text on the
screen and lcores 1-n are used to do the packet receive and transmits along with
anything else related to packets. You do not need to start at lcore zero, but the first
lcore in the bitmap from in the least signification bit location is the display and
timer lcore used by pktgen.

The -m format now allows the developer to have different lcores for rx and tx
instead of rx/tx on the same lcore. The above format of {1:3}.0 states to use
lcore 1 for rx and lcore 3 for tx on port 0. Make sure you select different
lcores for the rx and tx so that only a single rx or tx function is on
a single physical core. If you pick the rx/tx functions on different lcores, but
on the same physical core you will not be able to get the performance you want as the
single physical core will be trying to do both Rx/Tx functions.

The '-n 2' is a required argument for DPDK and denotes the number of memory channels.

```

** Note: To determine the Ethernet ports in your system use 'lspci | grep Ethernet' to 
   get a list of all ports in the system. Some ports may not be useable by DPDK/Pktgen.
   The first port listed is bit 0 or least signification bit in the '-c' mask.
   Another method is to compile the test_pmd example and run './test_pmd -c 0x3 -n 2'
   command to list out the ports DPDK is able to use.
```
A new feature for pktgen and DPDK is to run multiple instances of pktgen. This
allows the developer to share ports on the same machine.

------------- doit script ----------------
```
#!/bin/bash

# Normal setup
#   different cores for each port.

name=`uname -n`
if [ $name == "keithw-W2600CR" ]; then
./app/pktgen -c 1f -n 3 --proc-type auto --socket-mem 256,256 --file-prefix pg -b 0000:03:00.0 -b 0000:03:00.1 -- -p 0x00c -P -m "[1:3].0, [2:4].1" 
fi

if [ $name == "keithw-S5520HC" ]; then
./app/pktgen -c 1f -n 3 --proc-type auto --socket-mem 256,256 --file-prefix pg -b 0000:01:00.0 -b 0000:01:00.1 -- -p 0x03 -P -m "[1:3].0, [2:4].1" 
fi
```
------------- doit script ----------------

If you have run pktgen before then remove the files in /mnt/huge/* before
running the new version.

Running the doit script produces output as follows, but maybe different on your
system configuration.
```

```

A command line passing in a pktgen/test/set_seq.pkt file to help initialize pktgen with some
default values and configurations. You can also replace the filename using the '-f' command
with a Lua script file ending in .lua instead of .pkt. BTW, if the filename ends in anything
other then .lua it is treated as a .pkt file.
 
`./app/pktgen -c 1f -n 3 --proc-type auto --socket-mem 128,128 -- -p 0x30 -P -m "[1:3].0, [2:4].1" -f test/set_seq.pkt`

-- test/set_seq.pkt
```

set all seqCnt 1
```
The set_seq.pkt command file can also be one of the files in pktgen/test directory,
which are Lua based scripts instead of command line scripts as in set_seq.pkt file.

-- test/set_seq.lua
The Lua version is easier to remember the layout of the agruments if you want to
use that one instead of set_seq.pkt file.

```
./app/pktgen -c 1f -n 3 --proc-type auto --socket-mem 128,128 -- -p 0x30 -P -m "[1:3].0, [2:4].1" -f test/set_seq.lua`

    ["eth_src_addr"] = "0011:1234:5678",
    ["ip_dst_addr"] = "10.12.0.1",
    ["ip_src_addr"] = "10.12.0.1/16",	-- the 16 is the size of the mask value

  };

-- Socket Support for Pktgen.

Pktgen has a TCP socket connection to allow you to control Pktgen from a remote
program or console. The TCP connection is using port 0x5606 or 22022 and presents
a Lua command shell interface. If you telnet to the machine running Pktgen on port
22022 you will get a lua command shell like interface. This interface does not have
a command line prompt, but you can issue Lua code or load script files from the local
disk of the machine. You can also send programs to the remote Pktgen machine to
load scripts from a remote location.

One method to connect to Pktgen is using telnet, but another method would be to
use 'socat' program on a Linux machine. The socat program is very powerfull application
and can do a lot of things. I used socat to debug Pktgen using the following
command, which gives me a readline inteface to Pktgen's socket interface.

$ socat -d -d READLINE TCP4:localhost:22022

'You will see socat create the connection and then wait for Lua command scripts for you'
To exit this command type Control-D to exit and close the connection.

You can also just send Pktgen a script file and display the ouptut.

Hello World!!!!
--------

Here is the program I sent Pktgen:

$ cat test/hello-world.lua 
package.path = package.path ..";?.lua;test/?.lua;app/?.lua;"

printf("Lua Vesrion      : %s\n", pktgen.info.Lua_Version);
printf("Pktgen Version   : %s\n", pktgen.info.Pktgen_Version);
printf("Pktgen Copyright : %s\n", pktgen.info.Pktgen_Copyright);
printf("Pktgen Authors   : %s\n", pktgen.info.Pktgen_Authors);

printf("\nHello World!!!!\n");

Here is a command from my Mac Book pro laptop, which loads a file from the local
disk where Pktgen is running and then we execute the file with 'f()'.

-------------

- Update Lua to 5.2.3 and fixed setting vlan ID on single ports plus added new
  Lua functions. New Lua functions are ``pktgen.portCount()`` and
  ``pktgen.totalPorts()`` where ``portCount()`` is the number of port used by
  Pktgen and ``totalPorts()`` is the total number seen by DPDK.

  send forever problem.

Version 2.7.0

  blacklisted, which means the port index is now different. You will now need
  to blacklist or whitelist ports with the DPDK ``-b`` or ``--pci-blacklist or
  --pci-whitelist`` options. Pktgen does not blacklist ports anymore.
- Moved pktgen to the examples directory plus removed ``libwr_*`` from the lib
  directory.

  will be added later.

  theme commands.
